# p5-browserify

Example of how to run P5 (Ex - ProcessingJS) with ES6 in Browserify. Also comes with SASS because I'm like that.

Project is based on P5 version 0.5.

## ▶️ Run

Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## 🔧 Develop

`$ npm install` to install dependencies;

`$ npm run dev` to start a webserver at `http://localhost:8080` and to start watching for changes to files. I forgot to add live-reloading, so you still have to reload the page yourself for now, but you don't need to wait for Browserify to build every time.

## 📦 Build

`$ npm run build` will package all your JS and CSS into the `dist` folder. Send this folder together with `index.html` to anywhere.

## 💙 Contribute

I'm open for pull-requests if you have any enhancements or a later version of P5 changes things.
