# p5-webpack

Webpack boilerplate for P5 (formerly known as Processing JS) with live reloading. I use SASS as base styles because I can.

Project is based on P5 version 1.0.

## ▶️ Run

Just open `dist/index.html` in your browser.

## 🔧 Develop

#### Requirements

Yarn

#### Instructions

`$ yarn install` to install dependencies;

`$ yarn dev` to start a webserver at `http://localhost:8080` and to start watching for changes to files. Start coding!

## 📦 Build

`$ yarn build` will package all your JS and CSS into the `dist` folder. Send this folder together with `index.html` to anywhere.

## 💙 Contribute

I'm open for pull-requests if you have any enhancements or a later version of P5 changes things.
